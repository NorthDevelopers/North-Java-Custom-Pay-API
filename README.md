# Securely Embed Payments in a Java App

This is a Java application that uses the front-end React framework to demonstrate an ecommerce payment solution using <a href='https://developer.north.com/products/full-featured/custom-pay-api' target='_blank'>North's Custom Pay API</a>. The code in this repository handles the back-end payment process for a simple payment form on a website. The code that handles front-end part of the payment process is located in a <a href='https://github.com/NorthDevelopers/North-React-Custom-Pay-API'>separate repository</a>, allowing each to be deployed separately.

## Get Sandbox Credentials

To get started, create a free [North Developer Portal account](https://developer.north.com/register). This will allow you to get the sandbox credentials that are required to test the app. Log in to your account to view the official [Custom Pay API Integration Guide](https://developer.north.com/products/full-featured/custom-pay-api/integration-guide), then [contact](https://developer.north.com/contact) North's Sales Engineering team to get sandbox credentials added to your Developer Portal account.
